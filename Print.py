       I am Signing up for Replit´s 100 days of Python  
      challenge!
      I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day
      I will be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so i can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
